Borwein - Lewis Book on Convex Optimization 

J. Borwein and A. Lewis' book was particularly special to me during my learning phase in optimization due to its unique and excellent problem sets. It is a masterfully written book with a focus on non-differentiability. The authors discuss optimality conditions in detail, which are rarely covered elsewhere. Both authors had a clear passion for beautiful mathematics, and I hold them in high regard. A. Lewis visited the University of Waterloo during my time as a graduate student there, while J. Borwein sadly passed away just before I began studying optimization (although I did become housemate with one of his close relatives).

Recently, while going through my past Overleaf projects, I found the solutions I had LaTeXed for Borwein and Lewis' book. I had solved many more problems on paper, but only half of them were typed up. I wanted to share these LaTeX files with anyone interested in learning optimization.
