Borwein - Lewis Book on Convex Optimization 


In my previous life, I used to like writing down the solutions to the problem. J. Borwein and A. Lewis' book was one of the most special books for me at the time where I was learning optimization with its unique and excellent problem sets. A masterfully written book with an emphasis on non-differentiability.They discuss in detail some optimality conditions which were hardly discussed anywhere else. Both authors clearly had a love for beautiful mathematics and I had a huge respect for both of them. A. Lewis visited University of Waterloo at the time when I was a graduate student there. And J. Borwein sadly passed away almost before I started learning  optimization (I did become housemate with one of his close relatives.)

I was going through my Overleaf past projects and came across the solutions I Latexed for the BL's book. I had solved much more on the paper, and only half of them perhaps got typed down.  Anyhow, I wished to share the tex files with everyone out there who is interested in learning optimization.
